Let me introduce myself...

Hi! I'm [Ayo](http://ayoayco.com), a Software Engineer by profession who also occasionally *delves* into some art, music, and literature.

I live in the Philippines with my wife, Jen, and our little boy, Kahel. I work remotely so I do not have to physically be at the office most of the time... meaning, I have more time to go travel around with the fam to take pictures, eat local delicacies, and make lots of fun memories.

That's also why I think I can start blogging *again*. Let's talk more about the pros and cons of Remote Work sometime. :)

In this website, I write notes on technology and life as I experience them hoping to help, if not inspire, others to live more efficient and happier lives. If you want to learn more about the it, you can go read [the first post ever!!](/hello-world/)

I'm so glad you came by. Who knows? You just might enjoy some future posts, right? :)

## What is Google Firebase

Google Firebase, first and foremost, is a platform. You can think of it as a suite of services for all your backend needs. It offers all the basic features we listed earlier and more. It comes with SDKs, tools, helpers, and an active community to support your backend development.

We can't go through everything here, but let's go through some of the reasons why I think Google Firebase is one of the best (if not the actual best) choice right now for backend.

## Why Choose Google Firebase

Among the other choices out there right now, I decided to test out Google Firebase for several reasons. Let's go through some of them here.

### 1. Apps will be performant, secure, and easily integrated

### 2. Authentication as a service

### 3. Awesome file storage

### 4. Automatic database backups

### 5. Automatic scaling

### 6. FREE tier enough for even light production apps


## Why Not to Choose Google Firebase

Of course, despite all the sweet deals Firebase has to offer, it is not a perfect platform. Primarily I can think of three reasons why you might not want to go with Firebase for your app's backend.

### 1. It has limited SDKs

### 2. It offers limited queries

### 3. It is a NoSQL database


## Other Things to Note

Aside from the things I previously mentioned, here are some things worth knowing before choosing Google Firebase.

### 1. You don't hold your data

### 2. You will use JavaScript (JSON)

### 3. Firebase Console is constantly evolving


## Summary

So that's pretty much how we choose the backend tech stack for app development and a quite a *loooong* list of Google Firebase features.

If you are interested in more detailed posts on how to use Firebase, be sure to check back here in the coming days. I will probably write more posts about Google Firebase as I learn it.

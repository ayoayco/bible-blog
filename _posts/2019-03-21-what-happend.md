Sooooo

I started this blog, first because I wanted to have a place to record my journey into learning new Technologies; primarily related to the Web.

But, months went by and I stopped/slowed down in this journey. It turns out, it is not something that excites me now as much as it did when I was a bit younger.

Now I'm here thinking, so what am I gonna do with this now?

In all honesty, I still don't know. The only thing I'm sure of right now is that my passion for learning and growth in general is still here. In what, specifically, is something I still have to find out.

I guess we'll all just see. :smile:

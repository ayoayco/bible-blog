Oh, another new blog! What's this about?

**Full Hacker** is like [Life Hacker](https://lifehacker.com), but for developers. This will be a place to share some "Life Hacks" that developers want to share to other developers, like automation, new tech, freebies, tools, etc.

This is not a place to ask coding questions. We got [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) for that already. Instead, here, we just share secrets that make our work and life easier as developers. Let's talk about more of this later. ;)

Contributing is simple, hit us up with an email: [FullHackerBlog@gmail.com](mailto:fullhackerblog@gmail.com) or head over to our [Github](https://github.com/fullhacker).

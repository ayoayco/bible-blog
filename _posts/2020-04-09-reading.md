The constant stream of fragmented information on the Internet has seemingly rewired my appetite for all forms of information consumption--and it is tiresome.<!--more-->

I have been constantly skimming texts quickly without giving myself the chance to ponder.

The quick fix of on-demand television culture with unlimited options has made me lose interest in reading books and deep thinking.

I have been reacting much and thinking less.

An honest self-check had shown this has negatively impacted my focus and, therefore, my reality.

## The Solution

Going back to books, starting by [reading about effective reading](https://www.amazon.com/Lit-Christian-Guide-Reading-Books/dp/1433522268), has brought me back.

Intentionally planning a balanced reading diet--a combination of healthy books--has restored my contemplative habits before the rise of constant reactive thinking toward random bits of unwarranted information on social media.

But this is far from easy.

## It requires sacrifice

We all have limited time, and environments we are in are never so favorable.

I had to stop doing things I loved. I deactivated my Facebook for a time, and playing computer games had to be at a minimum. 

> “The only people who achieve much are those who want knowledge so badly that they seek it while the conditions are still unfavorable. Favorable conditions never come.” C.S. Lewis 

## Next Goal: Find Others

Endeavors like this is most beneficial when done with others.

It makes it easier when one is surrounded with other people who have love for reading books.

In line with this, I've been thinking about starting a small group dedicated for building each other's love for learning through reading.

There will be no reading requirements or fixed meeting schedules.

The only qualification of sorts is that you are currently reading a book.

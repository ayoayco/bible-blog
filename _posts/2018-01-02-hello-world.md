It's kind of getting old, I know.

A new blog... *again?* What's this all about?

**Full Hacker** is like [Life Hacker](https://lifehacker.com), but for developers. This will be a place to share some "Life Hacks" that developers want to share to other developers, like automation, new tech, tools, setups, and all sorts of time-saving tips and tricks.

This is not a place to ask coding questions. We got [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) for that already. Instead, here, we just share secrets that make our work and life easier as developers. Let's talk about more of this later. ;)

Contributing is simple, hit us up with an email: [FullHackerBlog@gmail.com](mailto:fullhackerblog@gmail.com) or head to our place over at [Github](https://github.com/fullhacker/fullhacker.github.io).
